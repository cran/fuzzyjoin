\title{Join two tables based not on exact matches, but with a function
describing whether two vectors are matched or not}
\usage{
fuzzy_join(x, y, by = NULL, match_fun = NULL, multi_by = NULL,
  multi_match_fun = NULL, index_match_fun = NULL, mode = "inner", ...)

fuzzy_inner_join(x, y, by = NULL, match_fun, ...)

fuzzy_left_join(x, y, by = NULL, match_fun, ...)

fuzzy_right_join(x, y, by = NULL, match_fun, ...)

fuzzy_full_join(x, y, by = NULL, match_fun, ...)

fuzzy_semi_join(x, y, by = NULL, match_fun, ...)

fuzzy_anti_join(x, y, by = NULL, match_fun, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A tbl}

\item{y}{A tbl}

\item{by}{Columns of each to join}

\item{match_fun}{Vectorized function given two columns, returning
TRUE or FALSE as to whether they are a match. Can be a list of functions
one for each pair of columns specified in \code{by} (if a named list, it
uses the names in x).
If only one function is given it is used on all column pairs.}

\item{multi_by}{Columns to join, where all columns will be used to
test matches together}

\item{multi_match_fun}{Function to use for testing matches, performed
on all columns in each data frame simultaneously}

\item{index_match_fun}{Function to use for matching tables. Unlike
\code{match_fun} and \code{index_match_fun}, this is performed on the
original columns and returns pairs of indices.}

\item{mode}{One of "inner", "left", "right", "full" "semi", or "anti"}

\item{...}{Extra arguments passed to match_fun}
}
\description{
The \code{match_fun} argument is called once on a vector with all pairs
of unique comparisons: thus, it should be efficient and vectorized.
}
\details{
match_fun should return either a logical vector, or a data
frame where the first column is logical. If the latter, the
additional columns will be appended to the output. For example,
these additional columns could contain the distance metrics that
one is filtering on.

Note that as of now, you cannot give both \code{match_fun}
and \code{multi_match_fun}- you can either compare each column
individually or compare all of them.

Like in dplyr's join operations, \code{fuzzy_join} ignores groups,
but preserves the grouping of x in the output.
